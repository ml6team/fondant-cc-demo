## Filter comments

This component filters the code based on code to comment ratio. The main motivation is to clean the
datasets
from examples that have too little comments (including docstrings) or too many comments,

The code is based on the PII removal code used as part of
the [BigCode project](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-dataset/blob/main/preprocessing/utils/text_extraction.py).
